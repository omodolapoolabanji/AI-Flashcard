            currently the response is in the format above, we need to convert it to the format below
            for each flashcard in response:
                flashcard = {
                    "front": flashcard.title,
                    "back": flashcard.content
                }

            Need to run other tests to see if the response is always in the same format

Inference: the results are not deterministic but there are similarities in accross all 27 responses


we can get the flashcard's key -> then iterate through each index of the list:
    my_list = [{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}, {'key3': 'value3', 'key4': 'value4'}, {'key5': 'value5', 'key6': 'value6'}]

for my_dict in my_list:
    for key, value in my_dict.items():
        print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {value}")
